                    <p>Each Eagle Valley Sitters candidate must pass our multi-step screening process which includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resume Check that verifies previous childcare experience of at least 2 years</li>
                        <li>Series of in-depth interviews </li>
                        <li>Social media screen</li>
                        <li>Background check and Reference check *we use an FCRA compliant screening and require a minimum of 2 professional references </li>
                        <li>Pediatric CPR certification verification</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Client satisfaction is our top priority. After a thorough consultation with one of our team members, we start a uniquely tailored search based on your familyâ€™s needs. We broadcast to a wide network both within our pool of sitters, and through outer-agency channels. Eagle Valley Sitters offers a 1 month free replacement period to ensure a perfect fit. We also offer backup care options in the event your nanny is sick or unable to work*
