                        <p>Cat was an absolute savior when I was in Vail visiting. I was stressed from deadlines with school, and she was the perfect fit to babysit my two year old son. She was so professional giving me check ins and photos and had the most calming energy.
                           I knew instantly that I could trust her with my little guy.
                           I sent her a rather long list of Information regarding my kiddo in terms of naps, food, cues, disciplanry rules and such; She followed them perfectly, my son and I cannot wait to get back to Vail and see Cat again!

                        <p>We used Eagle Valley Sitters to find a sitter for our 5 month old for an entire day while we were in town for a wedding. Our sitter was on time, kind, and caring. I felt my son was in good hands while we were away for such a long period of time. She was good at communicating with me and ensuring that we knew what was going on throughout the day. I would recommend Eagle Valley Sitters and would definitely book with them again!</p>
