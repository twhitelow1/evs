          </ol>
        <h4>What is your cancellation policy?</h4>
        <p>All cancellations made within 48 hours of the booking start time will incur a full charge. Unfortunately, there can be no exceptions to this policy. </p>
        <p>* Please note that cancellations made during Christmas Vacation weeks (12/18- 1/5) have a 7 day cancellation policy.</p>

        <h4>Is it possible to have the same sitter for every day we book? </h4>
        <p>It is always our goal to provide consistency where possible. The further in advance you book, the more likely we will be able to accommodate, and provide the same sitter across all days booked. However, this is harder to achieve for last minute bookings. </p>

        <h4>Are all of your sitters vaccinated for covid?</h4>
        <p>At this time we do not mandate covid vaccines for our sitters. But we are happy to provide vaccinated sitters upon request! Be sure to include your vaccine preferences in your client registration form when booking.</p>


        <h4>Are all of your babysitters CPR certified and background checked?</h4> 
        <p>Yes! All of our sitters are CPR certified and background checked with an FCRA compliant screening.</p>

        <h4>What is the child to sitter ratio?</h4>
        <p>One sitter can watch up to 4 children. If there are more than 4 children, 2 sitters are required, to remain in compliance with Colorado state laws.</p>
        <p>*If the children are in diapers, the child to sitter ratio is 2:1. Some exceptions can be made for evening bookings. Contact us via email at cat@eaglevalleysitters.com for specific information.</p>
